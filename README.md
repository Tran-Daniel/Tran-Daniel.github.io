This is my attempt at a personal website. It is currently almost nothing, very much a work in progress.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.


### `npm install`

### `npm run deploy`

Deploys the application


## Known Bugs
- Mobile view is messed up

## TO DO:
- Button Colors
- Spotlight Animation (Grow, Move back and forth, Color shift)
- Implement "Upcoming Features/To Do List" Component
- Implement Generic List Component (Work Experience, Projects etc)
- Display Resume in page
